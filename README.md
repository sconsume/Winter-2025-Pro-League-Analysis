# Winter 2025 Pro League of Legends Attack Damage Carry Analysis
Winter 2025 Pro League of Legends Attack Damage Carry (ADC) Analysis is a data science project undertaken at UCSD. The project spans multiple phases, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, missingness assesstment, hypothesis testing, baseline model development, and fairness assessment. Its central aim is to determine whether ADC players truly carry their teams in 2025 Pro League matches.

### General Introduction
League of Legends (LoL) is a globally renowned multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and published by Riot Games. Since its release in 2009, it has grown into one of the most influential titles in esports, attracting millions of players and fans worldwide. In LoL, two teams of five champions each compete on a dynamic battlefield called Summoner’s Rift, where the primary goal is to destroy the enemy’s nexus while defending one’s own. The game features a diverse roster of over 150 champions, each equipped with unique abilities that cater to various roles, ranging from high-damage carries to supportive and strategic playmakers.

The ADC is designed to deliver sustained physical damage and secure key objectives. Traditionally partnered with a support in the bottom lane, ADCs must navigate a delicate balance between survivability and damage output, positioning themselves to inflict critical damage during team fights. In 2024, ADCs transcended their typical role, finding success in other lanes, such as Top and Mid lane, due to their high damage potential and scaling prowess. This flexibility saw them becoming a meta mainstay across various positions, significantly impacting team's strategies and game outcomes. However, this dominance also led to deliberate adjustments by Riot. The runes and items that fueled ADCs’ power were subsequently nerfed in an effort to restore balance.

The competitive landscape underwent further transformation with the shift into 2025. A significant change was the removal of ADC's upgradeable boot option, Zephyr boots, in favor of a new Feats of Strength system featuring upgradeability for all boot options. While this system introduces dynamic choices for most roles, ADCs find themselves at a disadvantage. Their go-to option, Berserker’s Greaves, now pales in comparison to other upgrade paths, raising concerns about whether the ADC can continue to serve as the primary sustained damage dealer in professional play.

With the given context, the central question of this project arises: **In tier 1 professional leagues, the highest level of League of Legends professional play, does the ADC tend to have the highest amount of kills and damage when compared to other rules? Does the ADC truly carry at such a high-level of play?** Using comprehensive data analysis techniques, the project seeks to determine if ADC players in tier 1 professional League of Legends matches consistently record higher kills and damage than their counterparts, thereby assessing whether ADCs truly serve as the primary carry in elite play, providing insights that could influence strategic team decision-making in future matches.
